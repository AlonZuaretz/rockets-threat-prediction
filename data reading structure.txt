the timing aligns with respect to threats data set.

threats is first separated into overlapping sequences to form a tensor of dimensions:
 [num sequences, sequence length, dimension of each sequence]

for each such sequence, there exists a tensor of labels which is the presence of threats in the following hour.
this tensor is of dimension: [num sequences, num locations]

in addition, for each sequence, there exists an array called last_time.
this array will be used to retrieve the corresponding sequence of the articles data set.
It is the timestamp of the last sample of the sequence in seconds.

the articles data set is not split because it is determined by an already split data set


articles data set explanation:

columns 0 to 5 are for time
next columns are for embedding
first column is used to match the last_time argument from the threats data set
